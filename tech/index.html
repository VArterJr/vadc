  <h2 id="software-projects">Software Projects</h2>
  <p>Yes, I dabble in software projects. Here are just a few of the personal software projects I’m working on or have done in the past.</p>

  <h3 id="crapss--crapss">CrapSS &amp; CrapSS+</h3>
  <p>CrapSS &amp; CrapSS+ - A basic screensaver with effects and editable text. Many features could be customized. I’ve use this project as an experimental platform in SO many languages / engines.</p>

  <p>Currently working on a new release I’ll post here when done in six different languages / engines to see which I like best.</p>

  <p>Current test iterations being worked on are in Qt &amp; C++, Pascal (Lazarus), AppGameKit, Unity, Godot &amp; C#, Orx &amp; C++, and C# with WinUI.</p>

  <p>In the past releases were done in C, C++, C# &amp; WinForms, Unreal Engine, Pascal (Delphi), AppGameKit, VB, and JavaScript / Electron.</p>

  <h3 id="vinceartercom-modernization">VinceArter.com Modernization</h3>
  <p>This site has been around since the mid-1990s. There have been many incarnations with so many technologies. The previous design was built in 2014 and was designed using static HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.</p>

  <p>I’m currently rewriting the site using the Jekyll framework and Liquid layout engine (this is the version you are using right now). This will enable me to edit the site quickly in Markdown and have better standardized templating. At this point I’m using the same CSS design I had before, retrofitted (force fit) to work better with Jekyll and Liquid.</p>

  <p>I’m also experimenting with Blazor and SQL on Azure for a more dynamic layout and publishing approach. Honestly, I’m so happy with Jekyll and Liquid this dynamic version may not be a focus right now.).</p>

  <p>In the past releases were done in Perl, C/C++, ASP, ASP.NET (C#), VB.NET, WordPress, Geeklog, DotNetNuke, and plain old static HTML.

  <h3 id="goat---generic-oracle-access-tool-c">GOAT - Generic Oracle™ Access Tool (C#)</h3>
  <p>The goal of GOAT was to provide data managers with mixed database permissions the ability to safely query Oracle™ (or other RDBMs systems) without having to worry about accidentally executing updates. I wanted to manage rights with permissions but since some data managers needed full CRUD rights with a custom GUI editor we built, but not for direct, detailed querying, I wrote a simple tool that could be used for in-depth read-only access. At its peak on freeware channels it had over 3,000 users. Now it is mostly in the history books. There may be a few users still out there.

  <h3 id="sgp---spore-game-packager-c">SGP - Spore™ Game Packager (C#)</h3>
  <p>Spore™ was a great game (and still is). In the early days of Spore™ there was no way to synchronize your data between machines (if you played on multiple machines). I wrote SGP to package up all of the relevant data and sync it between machines. It was a fun little project that saw a few hundred users over its life.</p>

  <p>I really wish I had a screenshot of this app. It was really cool looking. The source cannot be built at this time because a GUI library I used is no longer available (remember that lesson when choosing Open Source libraries).</p>

  <h3 id="other-software-projects">Other Software Projects</h3>
  <p>This is just a partial list of the dozens of my “retired” software projects…</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Numerous scripts, written in various scripting languages, that make/made my life easier. I still use quite a few of these. The repo is available on GitHub. If you are interested in access just drop me an email.</li>
    <li>Service Control - Automation for starting / stopping Windows Services (AutoIt)</li>
    <li>ProtoNotes - A simple daily diary organized by dates. (C++)</li>
    <li>SuperBarX - A “super utility bar” for Windows 2000 and XP. (C++)</li>
    <li>TextFinder - Accelerated text file search utility with RegEx (C/C++)</li>
    <li>dict - A Mac style dictionary for Windows (utilized reference.com feeds) (C#)&lt;</li>
    <li>BetterDtop - An early HTML enabled desktop replacement for OS/2 and Windows.</li>
    <li>JDepends - Java class dependency checker and packager (Java)</li>
    <li>Many, many, more… programming is fun! I’ll post more when I can.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="hardware-projects">Hardware Projects</h2>
  <p>This is just a partial list “retired” hardware projects…</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Guitar / Bass Multi-Effect - Based on source from the JSFX project. It worked but was just too big to lug around.</li>
    <li>Guitar Stomp Boxes - Built a few “cloned” stomp boxes</li>
    <li>REALLY Programmable Thermostat - DEAD. Hubitat, Ecobee, Nest, etc. beat me to completion. It was way cool though. I was going for ultimate programmability.</li>
    <li>Camera Control - Ancient project to automatically snap pictures with computer controlled SLR cameras back when that was a very new thing.</li>
    <li>Many, many, more… maybe I’ll post more when I get the time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p id="figAsideMain">Me on some "coding days"</p>
  <p><br /></p>

  <p>I have to admit I love programming most of the time… and still some days it drives me crazy. As a technology manager and solutions architect for many years now I don’t get to code as much as I used to. Except for prototyping and as a hobby.</p>

  <p>I believe that architecting, designing, and writing software is both art and science. That rare mix of creative and algorithmic thinking isn’t easy to find. It is those that have that mix of creativity and critical thinking that seem to be the most successful.</p>

  <p>Education is important… and yet there appears to be something in the “DNA” of exceptional designers and developers. I learned on my own (initially) as an early teen and then was lucky to have wonderful, experienced developers coach me as I learned professionally “on-the-job”.</p>

  <p>Just some “deep thoughts” on software development. ~ Vince</p>
