            <h1>Software Projects</h1>
            
            <p>Yes, I dabble in software projects. Here are just a few of the
            software projects I've done over the past few years.</p>

            <h3><img src="images/goat.bmp" class="imgContentLeft" alt="GOAT Icon" /> 
                GOAT - Generic Oracle&trade; Access Tool (C#)</h3>
            <p>The goal of GOAT was to provide data managers with mixed database permissions 
            the ability to safely query Oracle&trade; (or other RDBMs systems) without 
            having to worry about accidentally executing updates. I wanted to manage 
            rights with permissions but since some data managers needed full CRUD 
            rights with custom GUI editors, but not for direct querying, I wrote a simple 
            tool that could be used for data managers with this need. 
            At its peak on freeware channels it had over 300 downloads. Now it is 
            in the history books.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/goatshot.jpg" alt="GOAT Screenshot" />
            
            <h3>SGP - Spore&trade; Game Packager (C#)</h3>
            <p>Spore&trade; was a great game (still is!). In the early days of Spore&trade; 
            there was no way to syncronize your data between machines )if you played 
            on multiple machines). I wrote SGP to package up all of the relevant data 
            and sync it between machines. It was a fun little project that saw about 
            three dozen users over its life.</p>
            <p>I really wish I had a screenshot of this app. It was really cool looking.
            The source cannot be built at this time because a library I used is no 
            longer available (remember that lesson when choosing OSS libraries).</p>
            
            <h3>Other Software Projects</h3>
            <p>This is just a partial list of the dozens of my "dead" software 
            projects...</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Service Control - Automation for starting / stopping Windows 
                    Services (AutoIt)</li>
                <li>ProtoNotes - A simple daily diary organized by dates. (C++)</li>
                <li>SuperBarX - A "super utility bar" for Windows 2000 and XP. (C++)</li>
                <li>TextFinder - Accelerate text file search utility with RegEx (C++)</li>
                <li>dict - A Mac style dictionary for Windows (used reference.com) (C#)</li>
                <li>JDepends - Java class dependency checker and packager (Java)</li>
                <li>Many, many, more...</li>
                
            </ul>
 
            <h1>Hardware Projects</h1>
            <p>More dangerous than software projects yet still fun!</p>
            
            <h3>ECG/EKG</h3>
            <p>Initially built from scratch and then I bought a kit to finish. It 
            actually works but isn't very accurate. And no it didn't kill me... yet.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/ecg.jpg" alt="ECG Project Picture" />
            
            <h3>Bedroom Closet Project</h3>
            <p>OK. I have to admit... I wanted to show two "hardware" projects but I 
            just didn't have many pics of my other electronic disasters... I mean 
            projects handy. So here's a shot of the closet we re-built!</p>
            <img class="screenshotSmall" src="images/closet.jpg" 
                alt="Bedroom Closet Project Picture" />
            
            <h3>Other Hardware Projects</h3>
            <p>This is just a partial list "dead" or "pending" hardware projects...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Guitar Stomp Boxes - Working on making my own "cloned" stomp boxes</li>
                <li>REALLY Programmable Thermostat - DEAD. Nest beat me to it 
                    and is way cool!</li>
                <li>Camera Control - Ancient project to automatically snap pictures with  
                computer controlled SLR cameras</li>
                <li>Many, many, more...</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Programming</h1>
                <img id="imgAsideMain" 
                src="images/programming.gif" alt="I'm a Crazy Programmer" />
                <p id="figAsideMain">Me some "programming days"</p>
                <br />
            
                <p>I have to admit... I love programming most of the time... and still 
                    some days hate it. As a manager for the past too many years I don't 
                get to code much except for prototyping and as a hobby.</p>
                <p>Architecting, designing, and writing software is both art and science.
                I firmly believe you are either a creative, algorithmic thinker or not. 
                I've met a few decent "coders" that weren't and they got by. Yet it is 
                those that have that odd mix of creativity and critical thinking that are 
                most successful.</p>
                <p>Education is important... yet there is something in the "DNA" of a 
                really good programmer. I learned on my own (initially) as a teenager
                and then was lucky to have experienced developers help me out as I learned 
                professionally "on-the-job".</p>
                <p>Just some "deep thoughts" on software development. ~ Vince</p>
