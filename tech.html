                <h1>Software Projects</h1>

                <p>Yes, I dabble in software projects. Here are just a few of the
                    personal software projects I'm working on or have done in the past.</p>

                <h3>CrapSS & CrapSS+</h3>
                <p>CrapSS & CrapSS+ - A basic screensaver with effects and editable
                    text. Many features could be customized. I've use this project as an
                    experimental platform in SO many languages / engines.</p>
                <p>Currently working on a new release I'll post here when done
                    in six different languages / engines to see which I like best.</p>
                <p>Current test interations being worked on are in Pascal (Lazarus),
                    AppGameKit, Unity, Godot, Orx / C++, and C# WinUI.</p>
                <p>In the past releases were done in C, C++, C# WinForms, Unreal Engine,
                    Pascal (Delphi), AppGameKit, VB, and JavaScript / Electron.</p>
                <h3>VinceArter.com Modernization</h3>
                <p>This site has been around since the mid-1990s. There have been many
                    incarnations with so many technologies. The current site is primarily static
                    HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.</p>
                <p>I'm experimenting with Blazor and SQL on Azure and something static that is
                    easier to manage using MKDocs (or a similar "Markdown" / markup publishing
                    approaches.).</p>
                <p>In the past releases were done in Perl, C/C++, ASP, ASP.NET (C#),
                    VB.NET, WordPress, Geeklog, DotNetNuke, and pure static HTML.</p>

                <h3><img src="images/goat.bmp" class="imgContentLeft" alt="GOAT Icon" />
                    GOAT - Generic Oracle&trade; Access Tool (C#)</h3>
                <p>The goal of GOAT was to provide data managers with mixed database permissions
                    the ability to safely query Oracle&trade; (or other RDBMs systems) without
                    having to worry about accidentally executing updates. I wanted to manage
                    rights with permissions but since some data managers needed full CRUD
                    rights with custom GUI editors, but not for direct querying, I wrote a simple
                    tool that could be used for data managers with this need.
                    At its peak on freeware channels it had over 3000 users. Now it is
                    mostly in the history books. There may be a few users still out there.</p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="images/goatshot.jpg" alt="GOAT Screenshot" />

                <h3>SGP - Spore&trade; Game Packager (C#)</h3>
                <p>Spore&trade; was a great game (still is!). In the early days of Spore&trade;
                    there was no way to syncronize your data between machines (if you played
                    on multiple machines). I wrote SGP to package up all of the relevant data
                    and sync it between machines. It was a fun little project that saw a few
                    hundred users over its life.</p>
                <p>I really wish I had a screenshot of this app. It was really cool looking.
                    The source cannot be built at this time because a library I used is no
                    longer available (remember that lesson when choosing Open Source libraries).</p>

                <h3>Other Software Projects</h3>
                <p>This is just a partial list of the dozens of my "retired" software
                    projects...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Service Control - Automation for starting / stopping Windows
                        Services (AutoIt)</li>
                    <li>ProtoNotes - A simple daily diary organized by dates. (C++)</li>
                    <li>SuperBarX - A "super utility bar" for Windows 2000 and XP. (C++)</li>
                    <li>TextFinder - Accelerated text file search utility with RegEx (C/C++)</li>
                    <li>dict - A Mac style dictionary for Windows (utilized reference.com feeds) (C#)</li>
                    <li>BetterDtop - An early HTML enabled desktop replacement for OS/2 and Windows.</li>
                    <li>JDepends - Java class dependency checker and packager (Java)</li>
                    <li>Many, many, more... programming is fun!</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Hardware Projects</h1>
                <p>This is just a partial list "retired" hardware projects...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guitar / Bass Multi-Effect - Based on source from the JSFX
                        project. It worked but was just too big to lug around.</li>
                    <li>Guitar Stomp Boxes - Built a few "cloned" stomp boxes</li>
                    <li>REALLY Programmable Thermostat - DEAD. Ecobee, Nest, etc.
                        beat me to completion. It was way cool though. I was going
                        for ultimate programmability.</li>
                    <li>Camera Control - Ancient project to automatically snap pictures with
                        computer controlled SLR cameras back when that was a very new thing.</li>
                    <li>Many, many, more...</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <img id="imgAsideMain" src="images/programming.gif" alt="I'm a Crazy Programmer" />
                <p id="figAsideMain">Me some "programming days"</p>
                <br />

                <p>I have to admit... I love programming most of the time... and still
                    some days hate it. As a manager for the past too many years I don't
                    get to code much except for prototyping and as a hobby.</p>
                <p>Architecting, designing, and writing software is both art and science.
                    I firmly believe you are either a creative, algorithmic thinker or not.
                    I've met a few decent "coders" that weren't and they got by. Yet it is
                    those that have that odd mix of creativity and critical thinking that are
                    most successful.</p>
                <p>Education is important... yet there is something in the "DNA" of a
                    really good programmer. I learned on my own (initially) as a teenager
                    and then was lucky to have experienced developers help me out as I learned
                    professionally "on-the-job".</p>
                <p>Just some "deep thoughts" on software development. ~ Vince</p>
