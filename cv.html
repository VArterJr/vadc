                <p>Trusted partner, across lines of business with customers and executives, that provided user-centric
                    strategies that increased the value and adoption of enterprise wide productivity solutions, while

                    past. Crafted and drove strategies for cloud based and mobile centric capabilities, directly
                    enabling global teams to work more effectively when they needed, wherever they were located at the
