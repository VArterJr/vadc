            <h1>Current Certifications</h1>
            <h1>Monsanto Company</h1>
            <h3>Emerging Technologies Lead</h3>
            <p>In my current role as Emerging Technologies Lead I manage 
                teams and efforts focused on identifying, testing, 
                implementing, and supporting Business IT innovation 
                areas. Our initial focus areas have been: mobility, geospatial, 
                content management, and social collaborative technologies. 
                We are also responsible for providing architectural 
                direction for Global Systems at Monsanto.</p>

            <p>In this role I guide and direct the teams and people, handle 
                employee development and performance management, forecasts, 
                budgets, cost center management, and provide global architectural 
                guidance on emerging technology. I work closely with business 
                users and other IT departments to evaluate technologies and 
                their value as well as helping to set direction on how technologies 
                will be supported by operational teams.</p>

			<h3>Previous Monsanto Roles</h3>
            <p>As Software Web Applications Team Lead I led several sub-teams 
                that each had a special focus: Portals and Collaboration team 
                (SharePoint / Microsoft Office Server System), Document 
                Systems team (Documentum, SharePoint, and related services), 
                Web Content team (typical web development focus for our internal 
                and external sites), 3rd party application support, and a 
                Domino/Lotus Notes team.</p>
            
            <p>I directed and led the initial teams and projects for 
                Domino and Documentum migration to SharePoint. During that 
                time I had an onsite team of 14 employees and around 55 
                contractors between normal operational teams and project 
                teams with a total budget of approximately $5M. I handled 
                all cost center activities as well as capital and expense requests, 
                Capital and Expense Review requests and presentations, 
                daily team lead and program management activities.</p>
            
            <p>I have been in project / program management, business 
                analysis, data analysis, and software architecture roles at 
                Monsanto. I guided implementation of project lifecycle 
                management in the web application space as well as setting 
                architectural standards for our division. Iâ€™ve managed teams 
                of developers, architects, business analysts, and project 
                managers.</p>
            
            <p>Other roles at Monsanto: Team Lead, Technical Lead, 
                Software Architect</p>
            
            <p>Specific technologies I've worked with in the past include: 
                Mobile, Social, Geospatial / Esri, SharePoint, ASP, 
                ASP.NET, C#, Java, JSP, Struts, Oracle (PL/SQL), MSSQL (T-SQL), 
                C/C++, VB and too many more technologies to list.</p>

            <h1>Reinsurance Group of America</h1>
            <h3>RGA Technology Partners Group</h3>
			<p>Led multiple sub-teams operating in product management, 
                business analysis, data analysis and management, and 
                infrastructure for a software arm of Reinsurance Group of 
                America. My teams focused on project management, business 
                analysis, and data management for some of the largest financial 
                firms in the world. Across the teams I managed over $5M in annual 
                revenue as well as employee, contractor, and financial management 
                of resources. At any given time I had between 8 and 20 employees 
                and contractors reporting to me.</p>

                leading intelligent underwriting engine / reflexive questioning 
                services. I travelled globally helping sales close business and

                of varying size using our frameworks.
