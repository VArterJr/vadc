## OS Backgrounds
I've been creating (tileable and fullscreen) wallpaper backgrounds since Windows started supporting them in Windows 3.x. I created a lot for OS/2 back in the day, but did not hang on to them. :(

These are all free for personal use. You may not distribute, sell, or charge for them in anyway without written permission from me (Vince Arter, Jr.).

Click the image to see a bigger example image of the collection. Click the Download link to download a ZIP file containing that collection's images. A few collections (like Spring 2024) are Works-in-Progress (WIP) and do not yet have many images.

_Note: These are out of date and I will be updating them as I move to my new hosting area in Microsoft Azure._

## Conferencing Backgrounds
We conferencing platforms (Microsoft Teams, Zoom, WebEx, Google Chat, etc.) started supporting backgrounds (and some even animated backgrounds), I started creating those as well. Here are a few of my favorites that I've created over the past eight years or so.

These are all free for personal use. You may not distribute, sell, or charge for them in anyway without written permission from me (Vince Arter, Jr.).

# Art
### Artistic Inspiration
As you can tell, I'm not really a graphical style artist. Music and writing are my main focus areas. Yet I love to dabble and sometimes the outcome is decent. I hope some of this is enjoyable for someone out there.
