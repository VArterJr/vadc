I've had this site running since around 1996 (in one form or the other). The site was originally called DaDen.com. Shortly after that, I succumbed to the trend to have my name as my domain. I sold DaDen.com a few years ago. I have many other domains, including arter.us, arterfamily.com, protoduction.com (and a few others) yet VinceArter.com has been my main, personal landing page for many years.

In the past, the site has been a sharing point for students who took technology and programming classes I taught at St. Louis County Community College. It has been a point for sharing ideas with friends, colleagues, and community developers. It has been a place to share pictures and music I've written. It has been a place to share code.

Over the years it has been implemented using quite a few different approaches to its layout and code. Recently (mid-2022) I'm working on a more dynamic implementation using Jekyll and Markdown (I LOVE Markdown). I plan to convert my Medium blog to Markdown here in the summer of 2022.

Other things you may see on the site: development ideas and projects I am working; thoughts on my personal study of music, computer science, philosophy, and other things.

Thank you for stopping by, and please look for more content to show up here in the coming months!
