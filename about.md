I've had this site running since ~1996 (in one form or the other). The site was originally called DaDen.com. Shortly after that, I succumbed to the trend to have my name as my domain. I sold DaDen.com a few after that. I have many other domains, including: Arter.US, ArterFamily.com, Protoduction.com [Protoduction.com has now been sold as well], and a few others for specific projects.

**VinceArter.com has been my main, personal landing page for many years now.** _[Arter.US](https://www.arter.us){:target="blank"} is our family, personal landing page._

In the past, the site has been a sharing point for students who took technology and programming classes I taught at St. Louis County Community College. It has been a point for sharing ideas with friends, colleagues, and community developers. It has been a place to share pictures and music I've written. It has been a place to share code.

Over the years it has been implemented using quite a few different approaches to its layout and code. Recently (mid-2022) I rebuilt the previous pure static HTLM5/CSS/JavaScript version with a more dynamic implementation using Jekyll, Liquid Layout, and Markdown (I ❤️ Markdown). I plan to convert my Medium blog to Markdown here in the summer of 2023... maybe.

Other things you may see on the site:
* Development ideas and projects I am working on.
* Thoughts on my personal study of music, computer science, philosophy, religion, etc.
* And other things I haven't thought of yet.

Thank you for stopping by, and please come back for more content in the coming months.
