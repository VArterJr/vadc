  <p>I’ve had this site running since ~1996 (in one form or the other). The site was originally called DaDen.com. Shortly after that, I succumbed to the trend to have my name as my domain. I sold DaDen.com a few after that. I have many other domains, including: Arter.US, ArterFamily.com, Protoduction.com [Protoduction.com has now been sold as well], and a few others for specific projects.</p>

  <p><strong>VinceArter.com has been my main, personal landing page for many years now.</strong> <em><a href="https://www.arter.us" target="blank">Arter.US</a> is our family, personal landing page.</em></p>

  <p>In the past, the site has been a sharing point for students who took technology and programming classes I taught at St. Louis County Community College. It has been a point for sharing ideas with friends, colleagues, and community developers. It has been a place to share pictures and music I’ve written. It has been a place to share code.</p>

  <p>Over the years it has been implemented using quite a few different approaches to its layout and code. Recently (mid-2022) I rebuilt the previous pure static HTLM5/CSS/JavaScript version with a more dynamic implementation using Jekyll, Liquid Layout, and Markdown (I ❤️ Markdown). I plan to convert my Medium blog to Markdown here in the summer of 2023… maybe.</p>

  <p>Other things you may see on the site:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Development ideas and projects I am working on.</li>
    <li>Thoughts on my personal study of music, computer science, philosophy, religion, etc.</li>
    <li>And other things I haven’t thought of yet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thank you for stopping by, and please come back for more content in the coming months.</p>
