This is just a first information page about my site move to using the Jekyll framework with the Liquid layout engine. My plan is that this will make my site easier to maintain than the static HTML/JS/CSS site I built from the ground up in 2014 and have maintained as a template ever since.

I'll post more information on how I transformed my old site to Jekyll and how I was able to keep the majority of my layout style even under the new engine. The content is 95% in Markdown which makes it super fast to create new content and get it posted more quickly than having to do layout in HTML.
