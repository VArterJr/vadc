## Version History
* Version 5.5 (13-June-2024): Changes on _Art_ page including removal of out of date notice and fixing sidebar sub-nav menu. Uploaded all of the new wallpaper packages and updated the _Art_ page to reference them. Several new packages added. Fixed copyright dates in all files.
* Version 5.4 (22-May-2024): Modified _About_ and _CV_ pages to better align with my experience and values.
* Version 5.3.1 (22-May-2024): Added out of date notice on _Art_ page.
* Version 5.3 (11-Feb-2024): Added Art sub page off of Media page with downloads of art I've created.
* Version 5.2.1 (27-Sep-2023): Enhanced C code billboard image.
* Version 5.2 (26-Sep-2023): Updated CV with Certifications and Accreditations.
* Version 5.1.2 (19-June-2023): Re-sync local and remote and updated comments.
* Version 5.1.1 (19-June-2023): Fixed the issue with _About_ page pointing to incorrect place for _CV_. (https://github.com/VArterJr/vadc/issues/2) Also posting fix for GitHub Action for `Release` only which is causing weird issues with the site CI/CD process. (https://github.com/VArterJr/vadc/issues/1)
* Version 5.1 (19-June-2023): Content changes in several pages as well as new images for things that have changed since the initial build. Fixed some link issues and made sure that off site links opened a new page / tab vs. replacing my site.
* Version 5.0 (18-June-2023): Moved off GitHub Pages and to pure Azure. Had to completely reset because there seems to be no way to remove the GitHub Pages Action. So clean repo and history prior to Version 2 is in the old archive (https://github.com/VArterJr/old.varterjr.github.io and https://github.com/VArterJr/old.vacroot). Cleaned up old images moving them to a subfolder called _archive_. Several content updates and corrections. Added an `exclude` clause to _config.yml_ so that README.md can be in the root folder for GitHub and not get deployed to __site_. Prettied up _404.html_. Changed GitHub Action to only work on `Release` and nothing else. Updated billboard image to something more recent.
* Version 4.x (vacroot static) & Jekyll (2.0 above): Merged projects so will start new with Version 5.0 above. Please ignore recent v2.0 notes.
* Version 1.1 (19-Nov-2022): Fixed an issue with Media page not having the correct permalink. 
* Version 1.0 (22-Oct-2022): Finished migrating Media from old site. Cleaned up a few things and it looks and tests ready for a 1.0 release using Jekyll and Liquid!!!
* Version 0.6 (05-Oct-2022): Migrated Reviews and Tech from old site. Need to figure out Markdown image centering on `asides`.
* Version 0.5.1 (14-Aug-2022): Finished migration CV content. One minor annoyance is that Markdown tables (and kramdown) do not support `colspan`.
* Version 0.5 (12-Aug-2022): Added `<article>` and `<aside>` support in layout and Markdown files. Not clean, but the only way to accomplish this I've found using Jekyll. Fixed a lot of CSS issues that were not working well with Jekyll. Added more content to the CV.
* Version 0.4 (27-July-2022): Fixed post layout issues. Cleaned up a few other items.
* Version 0.3 (27-July-2022): Tab images and styling now implemented. Fixed a few CSS issues converting from old to new site.
* Version 0.2 (27-July-2022): Dynamic post page fixes in place and some other minor fixes.
* Version 0.1 (27-July-2022): The first releasable version of the site using Jekyll and based on the current static implementation of vincearter.com.
