* Version 2.3 (29-Oct-2021): Fixes to many logo URIs that had changed over time (or were deprecated with company acquisitions).
* Version 2.2 (Jan 2020): Adjusted some design decisions in the past to make it more easily maintained.
* Version 2.1 (June 2018): Fixes to CV after some issues came up.
* Version 2.0 (May 2016): Re-build of CV to ready for use for new job opportunities.
* Version 1.5 (Dec 2015): Tons of changes and fixes.
* Version 1.1 (March 2015): Many design changes and fixes to CSS styling.
* Version 1.0 (June 2014): First release of the custom built site.
* Version 0.1 (April 2014): The first releasable version of the site using my own custom built template and design in pure HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Versions prior to 0.1 (1997 - 2014): These were built using various HTML, ASP, ASPX, and other approaches. Much of that code (almost all of it) was lost in a move in the mid-2000s.
