## Version History
* Version 2.0 (18-June-2023): Moved off GitHub Pages and to pure Azure. Had to completely reset because there seems to be no way to remove the GitHub Pages Action. So clean repo and history prior to Version 2 is in the old archive (https://github.com/VArterJr/old.varterjr.github.io and https://github.com/VArterJr/old.vacroot). Cleaned up old images moving them to a subfolder called _archive_. Several content updates and corrections. Added an `exclude` clause to _config.yml_ so that README.md can be in the root folder for GitHub and not get deployed to __site_. Prettied up _404.html_. Changed GitHub Action to only work on `Release` and nothing else.
* Version 1.1 (19-Nov-2022): Fixed an issue with Media page not having the correct permalink.
* Version 1.0 (22-Oct-2022): Finished migrating Media from old site. Cleaned up a few things and it looks and tests ready for a 1.0 release using Jekyll and Liquid!!!
* Version 0.6 (05-Oct-2022): Migrated Reviews and Tech from old site. Need to figure out Markdown image centering on `asides`.
* Version 0.5.1 (14-Aug-2022): Finished migration CV content. One minor annoyance is that Markdown tables (and kramdown) do not support `colspan`.
* Version 0.5 (12-Aug-2022): Added `<article>` and `<aside>` support in layout and Markdown files. Not clean, but the only way to accomplish this I've found using Jekyll. Fixed a lot of CSS issues that were not working well with Jekyll. Added more content to the CV.
* Version 0.4 (27-July-2022): Fixed post layout issues. Cleaned up a few other items.
* Version 0.3 (27-July-2022): Tab images and styling now implemented. Fixed a few CSS issues converting from old to new site.
* Version 0.2 (27-July-2022): Dynamic post page fixes in place and some other minor fixes.
* Version 0.1 (27-July-2022): The first releasable version of the site using Jekyll and based on the current static implementation of vincearter.com.
