## Music Examples
Below are just a few examples of music I've written over the years. The samples below are compositions I wrote using pattern ideation tools, notation tools, and recorded with a DAW.

There is a bit of space at the start of each song, so please be patient. I need to clean those older files up so their intros are a bit more polished.

Also, please note that I'm hosting these files on SoundCloud. If you have any issues with the player, please let me know.

### Musical Inspiration
For me, the music that I write is inspired by life. I truly believe that God made us to be creative beings.

Just look around you... the world is amazing. There is plenty to inspire your creative process be it music, poetry, drawing, painting... inspiration is everywhere!

* Family
* Love
* Work (Yes, even work)
* The World
