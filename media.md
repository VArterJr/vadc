## Audio Samples
Just a few examples of music I've written. The samples below are compositions I wrote using pattern ideation tools, notation tools, and a DAW. Note: There is a bit of space at the start of each song, so please be patient.

# Music
### Musical Inspiration
For me, the music that I write is inspired by life. I truly believe that God made us to be creative beings.

Just look around you... the world is amazing. There is plenty to inspire your creative process be it music, poetry, drawing, painting... inspiration is everywhere!

### Some of My Musical Inspiration
* Faith
* Family
* Love
* Work (Yes, even work)
* The World
