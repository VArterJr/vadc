                <h1>About Vince Arter, Jr.</h1>
                <h3>(And VinceArter.com)</h3>
                <br />
                <img class="imgContentLeft" src="images/facesketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of my face!" />
                <p>This site is... uhm... something. No, really it is! It's a
                    conglomeration of things. I've had this site since around 1996
                    (in one form or the other). The site was originally called DaDen.com.
                    Shortly after that, I succumbed to the trend to have
                    my name as my domain. I sold DaDen.com a few years ago. I have many
                    other domains, including arter.us, but VinceArter.com is my main, personal
                    landing page.</p>

                <p>In the past, the site has also been a sharing point for
                    students who took classes I taught part-time at St. Louis County Community College.
                    It has also been a point for sharing ideas with my
                    friends and community developers. It has been a place to share pictures and music I write.
                    It has been a place to share code.</p>

                <p>Over the years it has come and gone, seen many approaches to
                    its layout and code. You'll see stuff from
                    development ideas and projects I am working on as well as some
                    of my personal study of music, computer science, and Bible study.</p>

                <p>I have removed so much stuff (especially the developer forums,
                    other discussion groups, etc.) since there are so many others to choose
                    from these days. I hate too much duplication, so I've removed much of that stuff.</p>

                <p>Thanks for stopping by, and look for more content in the coming months!</p>
